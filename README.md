## General info
This project was done as a part of our VUT BIT study program.  

**For future students:** Please don't copy-paste our code... It cost us approximately 4-5 energy drinks per contributor each day to make this work 🙄 And... it would be complicated to explain this to the disciplinary committee 😅.
